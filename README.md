### User Story1
As a user, when I start the application, a list of beer recipes will be displayed. A beer recipe is a photo of a beer with a detailed recipe and ingredients. As a user, I have the option to register a free account or continue as a guest.
### User Story2
As a user, I want to register a free account and become a registered user, whereby I will be able to view and create beer recipes and publish comments about beer recipes to the BrüShr community.
### User Story3
As a registered user, I am taken to my personal account after registration.
### User Story4
As a registered user, I want to return to the home page where I can (a) search for beer recipes by keyword; (b) click a beer card on the beer carousel to see recipes and/or add comments; (c) create beer recipes; (d) update beer recipes I have created; and (e) delete beer recipes I have created.
### User Story5
As a registered user, I want the option to create a beer recipe. When I click on a link I am taken to a page where I can enter various details about the beer, as well as instructions about its creation. After entering the details, I can publish the recipe to the BrüShr community.
### User Story6
As a registered user, I want to be able to see beer recipes when I click on a beer card on the beer recipe. When I click on a beer recipe, I am taken to a page where I can see the recipe in its entirety. As a registered user I can leave comments on the beer card page that will be published to the BrüShr community.
### User Story7
As a registered user, if I have created a recipe and published it on the BrüShr site, I want to delete that recipe.
